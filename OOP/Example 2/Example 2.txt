Variable Output in C++

Overview

This C++ program demonstrates how to declare, initialize, and output different variable types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings.

Breakdown:

#include <iostream>: Enables input and output operations.

using namespace std;: Avoids the need for std:: before functions like cout.

int age = 20;: Declares and initializes an integer variable.

double price = 19.99;: Declares and initializes a floating-point variable.

char grade = 'A';: Declares and initializes a character variable.

string name = "Alice";: Declares and initializes a string variable.

cout << "Name: " << name << endl;   // Printing name
cout << "Price: " << price << endl; // Printing price
cout << "Age: " << age << endl;     // Printing age
cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl; // Printing grade

endl: Moves to a new line.

return 0;: Indicates successful execution.
