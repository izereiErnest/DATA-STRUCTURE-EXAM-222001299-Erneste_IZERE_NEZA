User Input in C++

Overview

This C++ program demonstrates how to take user input using cin and display a personalized message using cout.


Breakdown:

#include <iostream>: Enables input and output operations.

using namespace std;: Avoids the need for std:: before functions like cout and cin.

string name;: Declares a string variable to store user input for the name.

int age;: Declares an integer variable to store user input for age.

cin >> name;: Reads a single word input for the user's name.

cin >> age;: Reads an integer input for the user's age.

// Displaying a personalized message with the user's name and age
cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;

endl: Moves to a new line.

return 0;: Indicates successful execution.
