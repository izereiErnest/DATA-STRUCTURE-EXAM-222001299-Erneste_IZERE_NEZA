Arithmetic Operations in C++

Overview

This C++ program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

Breakdown:

#include <iostream>: Enables input and output operations.

using namespace std;: Avoids the need for std:: before functions like cout.

int a = 15, b = 2;: Declares and initializes two integer variables.

cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;        // Printing the sum of a and b

cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl; // Printing the difference between a and b

cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl;    // Printing the product of a and b
    
cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl;   // Printing the quotient (integer division) of a and b
    
cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl;  // Printing the remainder of the division of a by b

a + b: Computes the sum of a and b.

a - b: Computes the difference between a and b.

a * b: Computes the product of a and b.

a / b: Performs integer division of a by b.

a % b: Computes the remainder of a divided by b.

endl: Moves to a new line.

return 0;: Indicates successful execution.
